 <h2>Acting career</h2>
 <p> <h3>Early work (2015–2016)</h3>
    <em> 2014, while she was studying in Tbilisi, Georgia, film-director Alphonse Puthren had approached her six years before, 
    through clippings from a reality show which she had participated, showcased in Facebook. 
    Alphonse initially gave her an offer to act in his film which she refused. After six years, he phoned Pallavi with another offer,
    but she thought of him as a stalker. Alphonse then verified himself by sending a selfie, which Sai Pallavi compared with his 
    Facebook DP and identified him.[25] Then, She accepted the role of Malar in his film Premam.[26] 
    She shot the film over the holidays and, after the shooting finished, returned to her studies.[27] She went on to win several "Best Female Debut" awards that year, including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.[28]
    Then she took a month break from her studies to act in her second Malayalam film, Kali, which released in March 2016 and 
    directed by Sameer Thahir.[29][30] She earned a nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Malayalam. </em></p>
